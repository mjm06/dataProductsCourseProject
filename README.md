=========================
This repo (dataProductsCourseProject) contains the slidify presentation (index.html in the folder projectSlides) supporting my Shiny app, which is hosted on Rstudio's shiny server here: <a href="https://mjmarkey.shinyapps.io/sleepy-app/"> https://mjmarkey.shinyapps.io/sleepy-app/</a>.

The repo also contains the ui.R and server.R files that build my Shiny app ```sleepy-app```.
